## About me

I'm a Sound Engineering student who recently decided to take a career change into data science field. 

In 2022, I started my path in data science and machine learning field by taking <a href="https://www.coderhouse.com/certificados/63361e13dece68000e70f9dc"> Data Science</a> course at 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲. While learning about the capabilities of data-driven solutions, I began to feel passion and a great curiosity about artificial intelligence and machine learning developments. Consequently, I continued learning in order to join 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗟𝗔𝗧𝗔𝗠 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗰𝗮𝗺𝗽. There, I completed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/NGL7R4FEKDSR"> Deep Learning Specialization</a> by 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴.𝗔𝗜 and achieved the <a href="https://www.credential.net/d8190b21-0f24-4f50-9cbd-c15a8318d8d3#gs.iii8qy"> TensorFlow Developer Certificate</a>. Besides, I took part in a practice competition at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dariopaez"> Kaggle</a>.⁣

Currently, I work as 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗝𝗥 at [𝗠𝗲𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗧𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰](https://github.com/mecantronic/), involved in AI development applied to 𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗼 and 𝘀𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲 solutions. At this role, I continue my learning path by incorporating new tools such as dependency management and virtual environments, model tracking with MLFlow and Tensorboard, cloud services integration, app containerization (Docker) among others.
